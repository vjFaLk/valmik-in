Generalist with a keen interest in DevOps and Automation. Enjoy exploring new domains of work and incorporating them with technology. Love OSS and being involved in everything OSS.

When I'm not working, I'm - 

- Making Music (Well, trying)
- Building side-projects for fun
- Automating my room 
- Tinkering with my home server
- Playing video games
- Listening to podcasts

I'm also trying to build something that is very close to my heart - http://TrustedTherapists.in/
