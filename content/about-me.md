I'm a software generalist with a focus on DevOps. I really enjoy tackling challenging problems. I love everything open source. 
I'm also a teacher. I am a big proponent of _learning by doing_. 

When I'm not working, I'm - 

- Making weird music
- Automating my house
- Tinkering with my home server
- 3D Printing things
- Getting into historical rabbit holes
