I like being a techology generalist and have a keen interest in DevOps and automation. I particularly enjoy exploring new domains of work and incorporating them with technology. Love everything Open Source.

When I'm not working, I'm - 

- Making music (well, trying)
- Building side-projects
- Automating my room 
- Tinkering with my home server
- Playing video games
- Listening to podcasts

I'm also trying to build [Trusted Therapists](https://trustedtherapists.in), something that is very close to my heart.
