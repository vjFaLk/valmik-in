I'm a technology generalist with a focus on DevOps. I enjoy exploring new business domains and incorporating them with technology. I love everything Open Source. I believe communication is key to solving most problems in life

When I'm not working, I'm - 

- Making music (well, trying)
- Building side-projects
- Automating my room 
- Tinkering with my home server
- Playing video games
- Listening to podcasts

I'm also trying to build [Trusted Therapists](https://trustedtherapists.in), something that is very close to my heart.
