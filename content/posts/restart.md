I've been tinkering around with a lot of things in the last year. Everytime I thought about writing a "How to setup..." post, I felt like there wasn't much value I could add that didn't exist already. For eg - ["How to setup Home Assistant"](https://www.google.com/search?q=setup+home+assistant&oq=setup+home+assistant&aqs=chrome.0.0l8.3046j1j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

However! I'd still like to share some of the ideas that I've implemented that may not be out there, or a different implementation of the same idea. This sound a bit abstract, I know. 

As of now, I only have home automation topics in mind, but I might start writing about other things.

Here's some of the things I'm planning to write about in the coming month(s) -

- An overview of my home automation setup
- Controlling my air conditioner with keyboard shortcuts, cause why not?
- Controlling my bulb with my Mi Band, cause why not?
- Building my own (WiFi controlled) [Ambilight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PccI_pUTZXs) for my PC (which also works with Home Assistant)
- Room presence detection using Mi Band (or any other cheap fitness band)
- Setting up an environment to quickly deploy applications
